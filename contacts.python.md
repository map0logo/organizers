# Python communities and organizations

SciPy Latin America should reach members of other Latin American
Python communities eager to attend and even organize conferences.
Other groups outside the subcontinent should be listed as well,
provided that they have a significant number of latino members.

Please list communities by country in alphabetic lexicographic order.
When possible, included are URLs pointing at web sites and pages in
social networks.
